## Objective
Andrea's Haberdashery is a modern/minimalistic take on an old western travelor's inn. 
Our passion to provide holistic healing and comfort to our fellow weary travelors gives our website the edge 
in an ever developing world of health and self care.

My 4th and final Milestone Project is an Ecommerce Django Multi-App project. 
This project displays the knowledge I have gained throughout the course.
The skills learned in the modules leading up to this project including:
HTML Fundamentals, CSS Fundamentals, JavaScript, Interactive Frontend Developement, 
Python, Data Centric Developement, User Centric Development, and Django.
By adding Django to my skillset; I have developed an app that 
allows the user to make an account, reset password, add,edit,delete items in the cart, 
make purchases, and pull up order history. The app is a great way for our users to bask in self care, 
the excellent UX and Assesibility on a wide range of screensizes makes this app a a must for our users.

* Log in/Sign out
* Add products to cart

The app is fully functional on all screen sizes with extensive testing for each feature on 1400px, 1200px, 992px, 768px, and 576px screensizes.

* User Stories:

    with the option to add to cart or to view details. All products include an image, product name, shortened product dscription, and price.
    If the user wants to veiw details while browsing products, when clicking the view details button 
    a modal appears that gives product image, name, a full description and price with an add to cart option or close option.
    Specific categories of products are also available. If the user selects the shop herbal or shop succulents buttons on second carousel slides, 
    the user will be directed to those items on the home page.
